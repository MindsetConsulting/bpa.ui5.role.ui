## Instructions for Running Task UI Locally

Start the UI: Navigate to the taskui-wrapper directory within your project and run the start script from its package.json file (usually done by typing npm start in your terminal).

Test with a UUID: In the "Show Task UI" dialog box, enter the following UUID and press the button:

UUID: 95e362ab-8256-4a03-b70a-62c51033576f

You may also encounter a CORS error when testing locally. In order to by pass the CORS policy. You will need to install a browswer plugin or create a proxy (there are other options as well).
I used the Google Chrome plugin : https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf
