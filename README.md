## Instructions for Running Task UI Locally

Start the UI: Navigate to the taskui-wrapper directory within your project and run the start script from its package.json file (usually done by typing npm start in your terminal).

Open the UI: In your web browser, access the Task UI (the URL is usually http://localhost:3000, but it may vary).

Test with a UUID: In the "Show Task UI" dialog box, enter the following UUID and press the button:

UUID: 95e362ab-8256-4a03-b70a-62c51033576f
